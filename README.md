Local Cache - Mobile Systems Programming
========================================

Simple Caching system used to cache HS.fi API. A school project :-)

Modules
-------

This repository contains three modules (as folders): `client`, `server` and `vm` (virtual machine).

- `client`: Contains code for the Android mobile app
- `server`: Contains code for the NodeJS server that is deployed to RACS.
- `vm`: Contains Vagrantfile and cookbooks that are used to bring local virtual machine up. Can be used for testing how the app behaves in the production in development environment

See each folder's `README.md` for more information.
